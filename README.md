# VM Base for Using BOSH and CF CLI
This is a Vagrant based configuration to use BOSH and CF CLI from scratch. It also install "spiff" courtesy of "travelling-bosh".

## Caveats
You need to create a directory named: 

`bosh-deployments`

This folder will be mapped to your VM for your processing. By default, this configuration disables the "/vagrant" mapping.
